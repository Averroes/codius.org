# Writing a Codius application

Codius applications are nothing more than everyday NodeJS packages. The structure
of an applicatoin is fairly straightforward:

* ``main.js`` or ``index.js`` - The application itself
* ``package.json`` - Your everyday package.json, which specifies dependencies
  for npm to install

Codius also has a number of [example applications](running-the-examples) available.
